	abstract = {As nuclear power expands, technical, economic, political, and environmental analyses of nuclear fuel cycles by simulators increase in importance. To date, however, current tools are often fleet-based rather than discrete and restrictively licensed rather than open source. Each of these choices presents a challenge to modeling fidelity, generality, efficiency, robustness, and scientific transparency. The Cyclus nuclear fuel cycle simulator framework and its modeling ecosystem incorporate modern insights from simulation science and software architecture to solve these problems so that challenges in nuclear fuel cycle analysis can be better addressed. A summary of the Cyclus fuel cycle simulator framework and its modeling ecosystem are presented. Additionally, the implementation of each is discussed in the context of motivating challenges in nuclear fuel cycle simulation. Finally, the current capabilities of Cyclus are demonstrated for both open and closed fuel cycles.},

Utilizing the mathematical structure present in JFNK, physics expressions are modularized into {\textquotedblleft}Kernels,{\textquotedblright} allowing for rapid production of new simulation tools. In addition, systems are solved implicitly and fully coupled, employing physics-based preconditioning, which provides great flexibility even with large variance in time scales.

The main software development is being carried out in the CFDLab (http://cfdlab.ae.utexas.edu) at the University of Texas, but as with other open-source software projects; contributions are being made elsewhere in the US and abroad. The main goals of this article are: (1) to provide a basic reference source that describes libMesh and the underlying philosophy and software design approach; (2) to give sufficient detail and references on the adaptive mesh refinement and coarsening (AMR/C) scheme for applications analysts and developers; and (3) to describe the parallel implementation and data structures with supporting discussion of domain decomposition, message passing, and details related to dynamic repartitioning for parallel AMR/C. Other aspects related to C++ programming paradigms, reusability for diverse applications, adaptive modeling, physics-independent error indicators, and similar concepts are briefly discussed. Finally, results from some applications using the library are presented and areas of future research are discussed.},

	abstract = {Moltres is a physics application for multiphysics modeling of fluid-fueled molten salt reactors
(MSRs) (Lindsay et al. 2018). It couples equations for neutron diffusion, thermal
hydraulics, and delayed neutron precursor transport. Neutron diffusion and precursor
transport equations are set-up using an action system that allows the user to use an arbitrary
number of neutron energy and precursor groups respectively with minimal input
changes. Moltres sits on top of the Multi-physics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment
(Gaston et al. 2015) and hence uses the finite element method to discretize the
governing partial differential equations. In general the resulting system of non-linear algebraic
equations is linearized using the Newton-Raphson method and then solved using
the Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation (Balay et al. 2017). Assembly
of the Jacobian and residual, and the linear solve are parallelized using MPI which
allows Moltres to be run in massively parallel environments. Runs on the Blue Waters
supercomputer at Illinois have utilized up to 608 cores.
Moltres and MOOSE allow use of different basis functions for different system variables.
Because of the purely diffusive nature of the neutron diffusion equations, neutron fluxes are
typically discretized using continuous first-degree Lagrange polynomials and the degrees of
freedom are associated with mesh nodes. The temperature variable may also be discretized
with a continuous Lagrange basis, or a discontinuous basis of arbitrary degree monomials
may be employed depending on the relative balance of heat convection to conduction. The
purely hyperbolic precursor transport is currently discretized using constant monomials,
which is equivalent to a first-order finite volume discretization. Moltres supports both
segregated (through Picard iteration) and monolithic solutions of the equation system.
However, due to the feedback between the power spectrum and temperature dependence
of macroscopic cross-sections, monolithic solves have demonstrated superior robustness
with segregated techniques often unable to converge to a solution. This result emphasizes
the importance of a fully coupled multi-physics framework like the one that Moltres and
MOOSE provide and suggests that iteratively coupling codes devoted to single physics
(K{\'o}ph{\'a}zi, Lathouwers, and Kloosterman 2009) may result in limited flexibility.},
