	abstract = {As nuclear power expands, technical, economic, political, and environmental analyses of nuclear fuel cycles by simulators increase in importance. To date, however, current tools are often fleet-based rather than discrete and restrictively licensed rather than open source. Each of these choices presents a challenge to modeling fidelity, generality, efficiency, robustness, and scientific transparency. The Cyclus nuclear fuel cycle simulator framework and its modeling ecosystem incorporate modern insights from simulation science and software architecture to solve these problems so that challenges in nuclear fuel cycle analysis can be better addressed. A summary of the Cyclus fuel cycle simulator framework and its modeling ecosystem are presented. Additionally, the implementation of each is discussed in the context of motivating challenges in nuclear fuel cycle simulation. Finally, the current capabilities of Cyclus are demonstrated for both open and closed fuel cycles.},

	abstract = {There is a growing trend in nuclear reactor simulation to consider multiphysics problems. This can be seen in reactor analysis where analysts are interested in coupled flow, heat transfer and neutronics, and in fuel performance simulation where analysts are interested in thermomechanics with contact coupled to species transport and chemistry. These more ambitious simulations usually motivate some level of parallel computing. Many of the coupling efforts to date utilize simple code coupling or first-order operator splitting, often referred to as loose coupling. While these approaches can produce answers, they usually leave questions of accuracy and stability unanswered. Additionally, the different physics often reside on separate grids which are coupled via simple interpolation, again leaving open questions of stability and accuracy. Utilizing state of the art mathematics and software development techniques we are deploying next generation tools for nuclear engineering applications. The Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov (JFNK) method combined with physics-based preconditioning provide the underlying mathematical structure for our tools. JFNK is understood to be a modern multiphysics algorithm, but we are also utilizing its unique properties as a scale bridging algorithm. To facilitate rapid development of multiphysics applications we have developed the Multiphysics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE). Examples from two MOOSE-based applications: PRONGHORN, our multiphysics gas cooled reactor simulation tool and BISON, our multiphysics, multiscale fuel performance simulation tool will be presented.},

	abstract = {Moltres is a physics application for multiphysics modeling of fluid-fueled molten salt reactors
(MSRs) (Lindsay et al. 2018). It couples equations for neutron diffusion, thermal
hydraulics, and delayed neutron precursor transport. Neutron diffusion and precursor
transport equations are set-up using an action system that allows the user to use an arbitrary
number of neutron energy and precursor groups respectively with minimal input
changes. Moltres sits on top of the Multi-physics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment
(Gaston et al. 2015) and hence uses the finite element method to discretize the
governing partial differential equations. In general the resulting system of non-linear algebraic
equations is linearized using the Newton-Raphson method and then solved using
the Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation (Balay et al. 2017). Assembly
of the Jacobian and residual, and the linear solve are parallelized using MPI which
allows Moltres to be run in massively parallel environments. Runs on the Blue Waters
supercomputer at Illinois have utilized up to 608 cores.
Moltres and MOOSE allow use of different basis functions for different system variables.
Because of the purely diffusive nature of the neutron diffusion equations, neutron fluxes are
typically discretized using continuous first-degree Lagrange polynomials and the degrees of
freedom are associated with mesh nodes. The temperature variable may also be discretized
with a continuous Lagrange basis, or a discontinuous basis of arbitrary degree monomials
may be employed depending on the relative balance of heat convection to conduction. The
purely hyperbolic precursor transport is currently discretized using constant monomials,
which is equivalent to a first-order finite volume discretization. Moltres supports both
segregated (through Picard iteration) and monolithic solutions of the equation system.
However, due to the feedback between the power spectrum and temperature dependence
of macroscopic cross-sections, monolithic solves have demonstrated superior robustness
with segregated techniques often unable to converge to a solution. This result emphasizes
the importance of a fully coupled multi-physics framework like the one that Moltres and
MOOSE provide and suggests that iteratively coupling codes devoted to single physics
(K{\'o}ph{\'a}zi, Lathouwers, and Kloosterman 2009) may result in limited flexibility.},

tightly in nuclear reactors. Detailed spatially and temporally
resolved neutron flux and temperature distributions can improve
designs, help characterize performance, inform reactor safety
margins, and enable validation of numerical modeling techniques
for those unique physics. In the work presented here, conducted
on Blue Waters, ARFC has demonstrated the capability to simulate
coupled, transient neutronics and thermal hydraulics in an
advanced, molten-salt-fueled nuclear reactor.},

The Demand-Driven Cycamore Archetype project (NEUP-FY16-10512) aims to develop Cycamore demand-driven deployment capabilities. The developed algorithm, in the form of Cyclus Institution agent, deploys Facilities to meet the front-end and back-end demands of the fuel cycle.
This report describes numerical tests for non-optimizing, deterministic- optimizing and stochastic-optimizing prediction algorithms.
These prediction models are being developed by the University of South Carolina. In this report, we discuss numerical experiments for testing the non-optimizing, deterministic optimizing and stochastic optimizing meth- ods.

	shorttitle = {Advanced online fuel reprocessing simulation for thorium-fueled molten salt breeder reactor},
	abstract = {Current interest in advanced nuclear energy and MSR concepts has enhanced demand in building the tools to analyze these systems. This thesis introduces a Python script, SaltProc, which simulates MSR online reprocessing by modeling the changing isotopic composition of an irradiated fuel salt. SaltProc couples with the Monte Carlo code, SERPENT 2, for neutron transport and depletion calculations. SaltProc capabilities include a generic geometry capable of modeling multi-region and multi-flow systems, time-dependent feeds and removals, and specific separation efficiency for each element or isotope removal flow. Generally applicable capabilities are illuminated in this thesis in three applied problems: (1) simulating the startup of a thorium-fueled MSBR fuel cycle to find equilibrium fuel composition (when multiplication factor of the full-core model and the U-233 concentration in the fuel salt are invariant in time); (2) determining the effect of the fuel salt irradiation with online reprocessing on MSBR operations; and (3) estimating MSBR fuel cycle performance by computing the Th-232 feed rate over 20 years of operation and comparing with available data. In the first application, full-core depletion in the MSBR demonstrated that (1) equilibrium fuel composition could be achieved after 16 years and (2) the multiplication factor stabilizes after 6 years of operation. In the second application, fuel salt irradiation with simulated fission product removal and fissile/fertile feed causes considerable neutron energy spectrum hardening; this spectral shift has a problematic impact on safety parameters (e.g., temperature reactivity feedback, reactivity control system worth). In the third application, the average Th-232 feed rate throughout 20 years of operation is 2.39 kg/day or 100 g/GWh(e) which is a good agreement with other recent research. Problematic effects of neutron energy spectrum hardening during MSBR operation should be taken into account for neutronics, multi-physics, and fuel cycle performance analysis.},

In current reactors and their associated fuel cycles, capital, operation, and maintenance costs increasingly dominate the economics of nuclear power.
Advanced reactor designs and fuel cycle choices can impact these costs both positively
and negatively. While fuel cycle advancements also impact fuel costs, this component has a relatively small impact on the overall cost of nuclear electricity production, particularly in comparison to capital costs. If advanced reactors can offer very high-temperature heat appropriate for industrial processing, natively couple with storage technologies, or can otherwise acheive load following behavior, then they may become more financially feasible than the current fleet.},

Finally, drift of delayed neutron precursors must be incorporated into the kinetics analysis due to the mobility of the liquid fuel. This talk will discuss all three components. Toward the first component, a discussion of the SaltProc python package will establish the fuel composition dynamics capabilities necessary for fuel composition depletion in the context of online reprocessing. Toward the second component, a point kinetics model implementation in PyRK, and a more sophisticated advection model implementation in Moltres will be discussed.

Rapid modeling of hundreds of discrete waste packages in a geologic environment is enabled within this module by a suite of four closed form models for advective, dispersive, coupled, and idealized contaminant transport: a Degradation Rate model, a Mixed Cell model, a Lumped Parameter model, and a 1-D Permeable Porous Medium model. A summary of the Cyder module, its timestepping algorithm, and the mathematical models implemented within it are presented.

	abstract = {The French 2012{\textendash}2015 Commission Nationale d{\textquoteright}Evaluation Reports emphasize preparation for a transition from Light Water Reactors (LWRs) to Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactors (SFRs). We used the Cyclus nuclear fuel cycle simulator to explore the feasibility of enabling a French transition to an SFR fleet by using Used Nuclear Fuel (UNF) from other European Union (EU) nations. A Cyclus simulation captured nuclear power deployment in the EU from 1970 to 2160. In this simulation, France begins its planned transition to SFRs as existing LWRs are decommissioned. These SFRs are fueled with UNF accumulated by other EU nations and reprocessed in France. The impact of reactor lifetime extensions and SFR breeding ratios on time-to-transition were investigated with additional simulations. These simulations demonstrate that France can avoid deployment of additional LWRs by accepting UNF from other EU nations, that lifetime extensions delay time-to-transition, and improved breeding ratios are not particularly impactful.},

First, it is necessary to establish the dynamic  evolution of fuel composition via depletion and online reprocessing. Additionally, multiphysics analysis of the thermal hydraulics and neutronics in such a nuclear reactor must incorporate thermal feedbacks and material expansion feedbacks. Finally, drift of delayed neutron precursors must be incorporated into the kinetics analysis due to the mobility of the liquid fuel. This talk will discuss all three components. Toward the first component, a discussion of the SaltProc python package will establish the fuel composition dynamics capabilities necessary for fuel composition depletion in the context of online reprocessing. Toward the second component, a point kinetics model implementation in PyRK, and a more sophisticated advection model implementation in Moltres will be discussed, including neutron diffusion and precursor drift equations in Moltres as well as their implementation using the MOOSE action system. Finally, future directions for Moltres and SaltProc development will be noted.},

	title = {Investigation of {Agricultural} {Uses} of {Nuclear} {Waste} {Heat}. {UIUC} {Technical} {Report}. {October}, 2018.},
	abstract = {Nuclear power plants (NPPs) produce significant quantities of waste heat due to the low thermal efficiency of the Rankine cycle. This waste heat carries roughly two-thirds of the total power generated at a nuclear power plant. It is responsibly released to the environment as a warm water flow, carrying with it a massive amount of low-grade thermal energy. As of now, this energy is lost from all Exelon NPPs. This waste heat is essentially a free source of energy and utilization projects offer the potential to significantly increase the thermal efficiency and profitability of centralized power generating stations, in particular NPPs.
Agricultural projects, particularly climate-controlled greenhouses, may show the most dramatic benefit from waste-heat utilization. Due to the relatively low temperature requirements of greenhouses, heating costs may be eliminated or cut substantially by the implementation of waste heat. The technical readiness of coupling central power generation station{\textquoteright}s waste heat discharge to climate-controlled greenhouses is high and has been demonstrated. Implementing this combined heat and power approach to Exelon{\textquoteright}s fleet of NPPs could offer significant advantages over fossil fueled power plants due to their high capacity factor, and strictly controlled and monitored water discharge.   
Exelon NPPs at Braidwood, Byron, Dresden, and Calvert Cliffs hold potential to supply significant agricultural waste heat. Few regulations exist specific to the use of waste heat from NPPs, but the discharge of waste heat from NPPs is strictly regulated, mitigating potential for regulatory hurdles to its use in other industries. Waste heat from Exelon{\textquoteright}s NPPs is an untapped and potentially lucrative commodity. In the Midwest, the location of Exelon{\textquoteright}s NPPs offers interesting opportunities for waste heat use in agriculture. The cold Midwest climate is normally a limiting factor in crop diversity and heated greenhouses are an option for overcoming this issue, but the heating costs are a barrier themselves. With cooperation between growers and the Exelon Corporation, waste heat may be commoditized while also facilitating more efficient and diverse growing operations. Waste heat use is not limited to farming operations. There are a host of industries that can benefit from waste heat use that may be local to other power plants. The Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant is located ideally to facilitate the farming of oysters with waste heat or even provide heat for liquefied natural gas vaporization. 
This report details a preliminary analysis to evaluate the potential for utilizing waste heat from NPPs. From the exhaustive review of past waste heat efforts, agricultural options, and primary economic and radiological factors, the technical readiness is shown to be high and the concept is sound. It is recommended that a detailed analysis should follow that includes: coupling candidate NPPs to specific greenhouse architectures, exploration of high-value crop options in prototypic and bounding event environments, and a detailed economic assessment.},

	abstract = {In many fuel cycle simulators, the user must define a deployment scheme for all supporting facilities to avoid supply chain gaps. To ease setting up nuclear fuel cycle simulations, Nuclear Fuel Cycle (NFC) simulators should bring demand-responsive deployment decisions into the dynamics of the simulation logic. Thus, a next-generation NFC simulator should predictively and automatically deploy fuel cycle facilities to meet a user-defined power demand. CYCLUS is an agent-based nuclear fuel cycle simulation framework [4]. In CYCLUS, each entity (i.e. Region, Institution, or Facility) in the fuel cycle is an agent. Region agents represent geographical or political areas that institution and facility agents can be grouped into. Institution agents control the deployment and decommission of facility agents and represents legal operating organizations such as a utility, government, etc. Facility agents represent nuclear fuel cycle facilities. CYCAMORE provides agents to represent process physics of various components in the nuclear fuel cycle (e.g. mine, fuel enrichment facility, reactor). The Demand-Driven CYCAMORE Archetypes project (NEUP-FY16-10512) aims to develop CYCLUS{\textquoteright} demand-driven deployment capabilities. This capability is added as a CYCLUS Institution agent that deploys facilities to meet the front-end and back-end fuel cycle demands based on a user-defined commodity demand. This demand-driven deployment capability is called d3ploy. In this paper, we explain the capabilities of d3ploy and demonstrate how d3ploy minimizes undersupply of all commodities in a few simulations while meeting key simulation constraints. Constant, linearly increasing, and sinusoidal power demand transition scenarios are demonstrated. Insights are discussed to inform parameter input decisions for future work in setting up larger transition scenarios that include many facilities. And finally, the more complex transition scenarios are demonstrated.},

	abstract = {The University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) is engaged in work to develop a fuel processing system that enables load-following in Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs), an important ability that allows nuclear power plants to ramp electricity production up or down to meet changing electricity demand. Nuclear reactions in MSRs produce unwanted byproducts (such as xenon and krypton) that can adversely affect power production. In steady, baseload operation, these byproducts form and decay at the same rate. When electricity production is ramped down, however, the byproducts start to be produced at a greater rate than they decay, leading to a buildup within the reactor. When power production must be once again increased, the response rate is slowed by the time needed for the byproducts to reach their equilibrium level (determined by the radioactive decay half-life, which is on the order of hours). Thus, buildup of these unwanted byproducts resulting from ramping down inhibit proper load following for molten salt reactors. Fortunately, MSRs transport fuel in a flowing molten salt fuel loop, which means that a section of the reactor, outside the core, can be leveraged for fuel processing and "cleanup." The team will determine the feasibility of removal of these unwanted byproducts and de- sign a fuel reprocessing system, removing a major barrier to commercialization for molten salt reactors.

Toward this work, we initiated the Fuel Cycle Simulation task (Task 2) in August 2018 to more realistically model the online reprocessing system of the Transatomic Power (TAP) MSR. A Python toolkit, SaltProc v0.1 [1{\textendash}3], was developed to represent the simplified online fuel salt processing of a Molten Salt Breeder Reactor (MSBR). More recently, an advanced SaltProc version (SaltProc v0.2) was developed to generically simulate complex molten salt fuel reprocessing systems, including the TAP system, incorporating user-parametrized components into the fuel salt processing design. This report summarizes the progress we have made towards milestone M2.1: Demonstrate SaltProc and the steps toward the subsequent Task 2 objectives.},
