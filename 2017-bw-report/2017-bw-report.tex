\section{Executive Summary}
%Executive summary (150 words)
The Advanced Reactors and Fuel Cycles Group (ARFC) conducts modeling and
simulation in the context of nuclear reactors and fuel cycles toward improved
safety and sustainability of nuclear power. In the context of high performance
computing, this work requires the coupling of multiple physics at multiple
scales to model and simulate the design, safety, and performance of advanced
nuclear reactors. In particular, thermal-hydraulic phenomena, neutron
transport, and fuel performance couple tightly in nuclear reactors. Detailed
spatially and temporally resolved neutron flux and temperature distributions in
particular can improve designs, help characterize performance, inform reactor
safety margins, and enable validation of numerical modeling techniques for
those unique physics. In the work presented here, ARFC has demonstrated the
capability to simulate coupled, transient neutronics and thermal hydraulics in
an advanced, molten-salt-fueled nuclear reactor. 

\section{Description of research activities and results}

ARFC Blue Waters activity began in November 2016 when access to the ARFC 
allocation was initiated for PI Huff. In the ten months since the start of 
this allocation, Blue Waters has enabled ARFC to develop and test a 
first-of-its-kind finite element model of the transient neutronics and thermal 
hydraulics in a liquid-fueled molten salt reactor design 
\cite{lindsay_arfc/moltres:_2017}. 

\subsection{Key Challenges}
The current state of the art in advanced nuclear reactor simulation (e.g. the
CASL DOE innovation hub) is focused on more traditional light water reactors.
This work extends that state of the art by enabling similarly high fidelity
modeling and simulation of more advanced reactor designs which have the
potential to improve the already unparalleled safety and sustainability of
nuclear power. High fidelity simulation of performance in these designs
requires development of models and tools for representing unique materials,
geometries, and physical phenomena.  The current work includes extension of the
MOOSE framework to appropriately model coupled thermal-hydraulics and
neutronics of molten salt flow in a high temperature liquid-fueled reactor
design. Future work will include similarly challenging materials and geometries
such as those in sodium cooled, gas cooled, and very high temperature reactor
designs which promise advanced safety or sustainability.

\subsection{Why it Matters} 

%description of the potential impact of solving this research problem, and, if 
%appropriate, the educational outcomes. For exploratory allocations, indicate 
%whether the results will be used to substantiate a future proposal.

Nuclear power is an emissions free, safe source of electricity with
unparalleled energy density, baseload capacity, and land-use effiency. 
As we together face energy poverty, climate change, and simultaneous increase
in worldwide energy use, the world's energy future increasingly depends on
improved safety and sustainability of nuclear reactor designs and fuel cycle
strategies. Advanced reactor and fuel cycle systems are sufficiently complex
that sophisticated scientific software so high-performance computing resources
are essential to understanding and improving them.

In particular, insights coupling feedback between the reactor scale and the
fuel cycle scale are essential to the deployment and scalability of these
innovations in the real world. The work conducted in this allocation seeks
exactly those insights and builds a research program that trains future
reactor and fuel cycle designers in best practices for large scale engineering 
modeling and simulation. Additionally, development and demonstration
of high fidelity software for multi-physics in advanced reactor types builds a
foundation for future funding through the Department of Energy Office of
Nuclear Energy. 


\subsection{Why Blue Waters} To assess nuclear reactor performance under a
variety of conditions and dynamic transients, the ARFC group must conduct
myriad 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional finite element simulations using the
MOOSE framework and our in-house developed modules. This class of simulations commonly
occupy tens of thousands of CPU cores at a time and vary in completion time.
The MOOSE framework is shown to scale very well up to 10,000 cores. The ARFC
group has demonstrated appropriate scaling for MSR simulation above 20,000 CPU
cores (600 Blue Waters nodes). Transient and multi-scale simulations, which
require greater capability per simulation, are on the horizon for our work.
These may occupy up to 100,000 CPU cores at a time. Only a few of those larger
simulations will be necessary to enable better understanding of the dynamics in
these reactor systems.

\subsection{Accomplishments} 
Moltres \cite{lindsay_arfc/moltres:_2017} is
a physics application for multiphysics modeling of fluid-fuelled molten salt
reactors (MSRs). It couples equations for neutron diffusion, thermal
hydraulics, and delayed neutron precursor transport. Neutron diffusion and
precursor transport equations are set up using an action system that allows the
user to use an arbitrary number of neutron energy and precursor groups
respectively with minimal input changes. Moltres sits atop the Multi-physics
Object-Oriented Simulation Environment \cite{gaston_moose:_2009} which gives it the
capability to run seamlessly in massively parallel environments. To date,
Moltres has been used to simulate MSRs in 2D-axisymmetric and 3D geometric
configurations. As these simulations increase in fidelity, their results will
be able to inform the safety and sustainability case for deployment of advanced
commercial nuclear reactors.

Moltres solves arbitrary-group neutron diffusion, temperature, and precursor
governing equations in anywhere from one to three dimensions and can be
deployed on an arbitrary number of processing units. The model problem
presented here has a 2D-axisymmetric geometry with heterogeneous group
constants for fuel and moderator regions. Fuel volume fraction and fuel salt
composition are based on the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment design. Figure 
\ref{fig:flux} demonstrates that neutron
fluxes show expected cosinusoidal shapes in radial and axial directions with
visible striations between fuel and moderator regions. The fast group flux is
enhanced in fuel regions while the thermal group flux in enhanced in moderator
regions. 

\begin{figure}[htb]
        \begin{center}
                \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{flux.eps}
        \end{center}
        \caption{This image shows the neutron flux in a 2-D cylindrical axisymmetric model of an MSR. This flux has the anticipated magnitude and canonical cosine shape (r = 0 is center of core) and is undergoing validation against experimental results from the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment.}
        \label{fig:flux}
\end{figure}

In Figure \ref{fig:temp}, it can be seen that the temperature profile increases monotonically in
the direction of salt flow. This is due to advection. 

\begin{figure}[htb]
        \begin{center}
                \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{temp.eps}
        \end{center}
        \caption{This image shows the temperature in a 2-D cylindrical axisymmetric model of an MSR. The reactor core temperature peaks near the reactor outlet in this 2-D axisymmetric model because of fuel advection (r = 0 is center of core).} 
        \label{fig:temp}
\end{figure}

The role of advection is also seen in precursor
concentrations. Long lived precursors exhibit maximum concentrations at the
core outlet, as seen in Figure \ref{fig:pre1}


\begin{figure}[htb]
        \begin{center}
                \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{pre1.eps}
        \end{center}
        \caption{This image shows the concentration of some particularly 
        important fission-product nuclides called delayed neutron precursors.  
        The concentration of the group of longest lived precursors ($\lambda = 
        1.24\times{10}^{-2}{s}^{-1}$) peaks near the reactor outlet in this 2-D 
        axisymmetric model (r = 0 is center of core).} 
        \label{fig:pre1}
\end{figure}

As the decay constant increases across precursor groups the maximum
concentrations moves towards the reactor center where the precursor production
rate is maximum. Future Moltres work includes generating a high-fidelity 3D
model as well as investigating various transient accident scenarios.

\section{Plan for next year}

The development of the Moltres software  began in September 2016 and has now been
demonstrated on hundreds of nodes on Blue Waters. We will scale it up to much
larger problems this year. In particular, we will emphasize transient 
accident scenarios in the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment design (which will 
require simulations over many hundreds of timesteps) as well as a much 
(spatially) larger reactor, the Molten Salt Breeder Reactor design.

\label{fig:proj}
\end{figure}

The following updates will result in a step change for our research 
productivity this year. 

\begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Larger Scale Problems} The software we developed in house 
                (moltres) is now capable of 3D simulation. Its performance is 
                currently memory constrained.  Distributed Mesh memory handling 
                will be implemented in the near term in order to overcome this 
                barrier. 
        \item \textbf{Monte-Carlo Cross-Section Generation} The ARFC group intends to begin working with monte-carlo software for 
        cross section generation. Ideally, we would like to run Serpent 2 or 
                OpenMC. The Serpent 2 software is fully parallelizable, very 
                memory intensive, and will produce very high fidelity results. 
                If we are able to use it on Blue Waters, the quality of our 
                results will improve enormously, as will the computational 
                intensity of our work.
\item \textbf{Quadrupling Group Size} The number of graduate students in the Advanced Reactors and Fuel Cycles
        \item \textbf{Expansion into Agent Based Modeling} The scope of the 
                work within ARFC will be expanded to include some capacity 
                computing work. While this is not the bulk of ARFC work, we 
                have a project in statistical optimization methods for agent 
                based modeling (the Cyclus application 
                \cite{huff_fundamental_2016}) which could benefit 
                from a few hundreds or thousands of independent single-node 
                runs.  group will quadruple this year, from 2 to 8. 
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{System nodes needed per run:} 20 - 5,000. Many simulations will be 
run on 100-200 nodes, while a few much larger simulations will be run on 5,000 
nodes. While it is possible, it is unlikely that we will run larger runs 
this year.
\paragraph{Anticipated memory usage:} Unknown.
\paragraph{Expected numerical operations:} Unknown.
\paragraph{Expected local and remote memory accesses:} Unknown. 
\paragraph{Total Node Hours:} Approximately 30,000 node hours.
\paragraph{Anticipated data transfer:} Data transfer will be in the ``few 
gigabytes'' per run for most runs. Large runs may be in the ``tens of 
gigabytes.''
